<h1>The novel&nbsp;writer with random&nbsp;death</h1>

<p>This is a toy inspired by a Twitter joke, and that should
tell you all you need to know about the practical value of this.</p>

<p>Start typing your novel into the box below and, if you have JavaScript
enabled and I haven't screwed up somewhere, you will find your characters
being automatically killed off every <strong>50 words</strong>.</p>

<p>Since this is a toy, I do not promise logic, sanity or grammar.</p>

<p>Tweet your own contributions to my list of random deaths to
<a href="http://twitter.com/dorward">@dorward</a>. If you get
some amusing output, then please blog it and tweet me the link.</p>

<p><strong>The spacebar is magical</strong>, it is the act of pressing
the spacebar after typing the 50th (100th, 150th, etc) word that sends
the coffee fueled scribes hunting for names in your text.</p>

<p><strong>Pasting is also magical</strong>. Without regard to the
number of words in the text, if you paste something and the complete
text includes at least one character, then one of them will die.</p>

<textarea></textarea>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>You will find that characters sharing names with English words (Smith
and John for example) will be immortal as names are compared against a
dictionary ("John Smith" is not a dictionary word though, so he should be
afraid, very afraid). In retrospect, I'd probably have been better off
looking to see if a name was at the start of a sentence instead of being
in the dictionary (but that would have got its own set of false positives
and negatives)</p>
